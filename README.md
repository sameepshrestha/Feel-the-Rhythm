# Feel-the-Rhythm

#Background
Western Power is a Western Australian State Government owned corporation responsible for building, maintaining and operating an electricity network that connects 2.3 million people to traditional and renewable energy sources, delivering an essential service to the community.

The teams at Western Power perform a range of tasks across their operations, and they are looking to better understand what factors contribute to an increased likelihood of safety incidents occurring. 

This challenge is specifically designed to look at the impact of body clocks, circadian rhythms and work schedules on the likelihood of incidents. 

#The Challenge
In this challenge you are asked to build and submit a model that can predict when incidents are more likely to occur, and provide an explanation of your findings and predictions in a report.

You will be provided with both employee timesheet data and incident data from Western Power, between 2014 and 2019. You will also be provided with supplementary data around the incidents to aid your explanations. 

#Model Requirements
The winning model is required to deliver the following:

All scripts in Python only (we are working on introducing additional languages to this process over time).
The model must execute in the Unearthed CrowdML Pipeline which executes within the unearthed/sagemaker-scikit-learn:0.23-1-cpu-py3 Docker container.
The template provides guidance on where to process data, develop models and make submissions - be careful about changing this.
Clean code, explanation of your code and process in a README document, modularity, and readability are requirements.
